# Python-Candlestick-Chart-From-Scratch-
This project uses only 'matplotlib', 'numpy' and 'pandas' to make candle stick chart from scratch. There are many packages one could use to make a Candlestick Chart very quickly, however, the fun was in the challenge of making it for myself just using. Features a link to a yahoo finance csv file, ability to chose how many days prior to the most recent day to view. This is a similar capability found in popular trading platforms like TD's "Think or Swim". From humble beginnings, we can build more sophisticated functionality.
